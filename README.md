# hiittimer
Simple timer for HIIT exercises.

This is a fun exercise of "how can we make a little web app without using a framework". This is all vanilla JS/CSS/HTML. For the JS I attempted to create my own wrapper around the application state to help make the code a little cleaner and easier to work with.

To run just load the HTML file, no building or anything else required.

Adjust the number of exercises, the active and rest periods, press start and get moving!
